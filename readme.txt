This is a trading simulator that was written a while back when I first started learning python and a bit of web servers. 
It was used to benchmark against investment vs actively trading. A few portfolios were made and different strategies 
were used to keep track of which one generated the highest returns. I used my own computer as a server so that I can 
make modifications to the actively traded portfolio on the go.
